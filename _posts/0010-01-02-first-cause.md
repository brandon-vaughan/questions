title: The First Cause

categories: question

class: question--cause

question_lead: "Who or what brought you into existence, gave your parents the power and ability to create you, infused you with your unique characteristics, decided upon your strengths? Who or what determined that in creation a cause produces an effect?"

example_lead: "Consider a painting. The Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci. Da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa, and in so doing, caused the Mona Lisa into existence. He created it. The painting did not create itself, but was caused by another. Its existence depended upon another. The same holds true for the painter himself. Da Vinci did not cause his own existence; he did not create himself. Someone or something else caused or created Leonardo da Vinci."

answer: "Some things—including every painting and every painter—are caused; and anything caused, is caused (or created) by another. Something cannot create (or cause) itself, and therefore everything caused or created must have something or someone that caused or created it. With that, the world, and all creation, is finite; nothing created exists forever or continues forever, in creation. Instead, everything created has a beginning, has a cause. Therefore, something with infinite power and capability—indeed, power over the infinite itself—must begin this process and must create such a finite created order. The following explains why. If everything created is finite, there cannot be an infinite series of causes in a backward direction (forever and ever) in time, with each thing created having something before it that created it. A finite created order cannot therefore produce an infinite series of events—i.e., an infinite series of causes backward in time without an origin. There must, with certainty, have at some point been a first cause—a cause that is not or was not itself caused by another, but which caused the first element of creation and who therefore existed before creation. This first cause and first creator must be God. "

example_larger: "Consider it this way; creation cannot return forever into the past. At some point, creation—with mathematical certainty—must have a beginning, a first cause that brought creation out of nothing. Something or someone that pre-dated first creation and therefore had the power to create out of nothing (before creation there, by default, was nothing created), must therefore exist. Returning to the “Big Bang” theory; the “Big Bang” either occurred out of nothing or required some material, conditions, or other elements to interact in such a way that this interaction produced a “Big Bang”. Therefore, someone or something with power to create or cause such a “Bang” to come from nothing, or to create the material, conditions, or other elements that produced the “Big Bang” had to exist beforehand, and had to be able to create these elements (and indeed, all creation) out of nothing. Otherwise, the “Big Bang” would have occurred out of nothing, with no preexisting material, created conditions, or other elements applying to the event. Something, however, cannot come from nothing…unless someone or something, which can create something out of nothing, already exists, and existed before creation itself."

question_larger: "Why, or toward what end, did this first causer, this first creator, begin to create, to cause something to exist where it had not previously existed? Why are you a part of this process of cause and creation?"
