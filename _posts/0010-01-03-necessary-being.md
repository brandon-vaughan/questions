title: The Necessary Being

categories: question

class: question--necessary

question_lead: "What is the origin of your lineage, your family tree? When did your line of ancestors…begin?"

example_lead: "A man and a woman can bring about the creation of a child, a new life. This new life grows within the mother’s body, but does so apart from the mother’s or father’s direction or action. Within the first three weeks, the baby takes on a human shape. The foundations for the digestive system, kidneys, muscles, bones, eyes, skin, hair, spinal cord, brain, and nervous systems form. By week five, the baby’s heart begins to beat. By week eight, the child has its own fingerprints, and its lungs, brain, kidneys, and liver begin to function. By week 12, it begins to move in the womb. The child is an independent life, a created being different from any other created being, but its existence is contingent upon the original action of her mother and father, an action that brought this new life about."

answer: "Every contingent being (i.e., a created being dependent upon its creation from an external source, from someone or something else that existed before it; human beings, plants, and animals, for example) at some time did not exist. A person at one point did not exist. That person’s mother and father at one point did not exist. Something cannot come from nothing; something contingent cannot create itself. A human being cannot create itself. A dog cannot create itself. A rose cannot create itself. One might argue that every contingent being always had something or someone before it bringing its contingent existence about, forever into the past. Every human being has parents, their parents had parents, and so on, with no beginning to the sequence. This infinite regression into the past is not mathematically possible. There cannot be an infinite series of sources—in a backward direction (forever and ever) in time—bringing about a contingent being. All that is created and all that is contingent had to have an ultimate source, which brings about all the matter, material, and elements that make up creation. Therefore, there must be an original (and not created, not contingent) being that begins all contingent creation as well as brings contingent creation into existence. This necessary being must be God."

example_larger: "Every created thing has a beginning, before which it did not exist. Creation cannot return forever into the past. At some point, creation itself—with mathematical certainty—must have a beginning; the matter, material, and elements that form created material, from planets, to persons, to air, to water, must have a beginning. All material that makes up creation cannot have come from nothing. Something or someone that pre-dated first creation and therefore had the power to create out of nothing (before creation there is nothing), must therefore exist."

question_larger: "Why, or toward end, did a necessary being begin to create contingent life, and set in motion the continuing creation of contingent life."
