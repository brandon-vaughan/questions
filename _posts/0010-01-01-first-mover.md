title: The First Mover

class: question--mover

categories: question

question_lead: "Who or what set in motion the expansion of the universe, a sunset, the wind blowing, a child breath, or time continuing from one day to the next?"

example_lead: "Picture a particular flat rock, lying along a riverbank. It’s red, amidst an endless sea of gray rocks. It does not move. It cannot move on its own. A child comes alongside the riverbank, takes off his shoes and socks, and moves toward the water. As he does so, he comes upon this white pebble, picks it up, studies it, winds up, and slings it into the water. It glides, skipping once, twice, and a third time along the surface before disappearing beneath the waves, gravity having pushed it downward. The rock was set in motion. The child set the flat, white rock in motion; gravity then moved it downward, into the water, where it disappeared. Without the child, the rock would have remained still. Without gravity, the child’s toss would have set the rock in flight indefinitely."

answer: "Some things—from rocks along a riverbank to stars in the sky—are or can be in motion. Anything in motion is moved, at some point, by another actor, action, or event. There cannot be an infinite series of movers in a backward direction (forever and ever) in time; so, there must, with certainty, be a first mover—a mover that is not itself moved by another, that is independent of all else and exists before the first movement occurred. This first mover must be God."

example_larger: "The universe is ever-expanding, ever in motion. Someone or something with the power over an “ever-expanding” motion, an ever-expanding creation, must have set that ever-expanding universe in motion. The “Big Bang” theory argues that the created universe was made in an instant, via a single immense event. This “Bang” either occurred out of nothing or required some material, conditions, or other elements to interact in such a way that this interaction produced a “Big Bang”. Someone or something with the power to set such material, conditions, or other elements in motion, or to set the “Big Bang” itself in motion from nothing, had to commence that movement and had to therefore exist before creation itself, before anything else existed."

question_larger: " Why, or toward what end, did this first mover commence the very first movement that set creation, or the created order, moving?"
