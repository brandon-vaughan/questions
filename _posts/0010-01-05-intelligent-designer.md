title: An Intelligent Designer

categories: question

class: question--intelligent

question_lead: "Albert Einstein said, “What goes up, must come down”. Why is that true? Why does your heart break when a loved one hurts you? Why are you be disappointed when something you long for fails to arrive? Why must the earth spin around the sun? Why are the scientific explanations for each of these questions accurate? What makes the scientific explanations for each of these questions accurate?"

example_lead: "A tiger sits at the edge of a jungle clearing, poised to leap at several nearby zebras graving in a field. The tiger hunts for food, but does so without making a rational decision to do so. It does not and cannot consider the consequences or possibilities associated with a failure to hunt. Its nature directs it to hunt. A child tosses a ball up in the air. The ball goes up, and then comes down. The ball cannot do otherwise, and the child cannot make it do otherwise. It must, as Albert Einstein said, “come down”. When the sun goes down, the natural temperature of the air outside gets colder. Man cannot control this order."

answer: "Many things in the world that lack intelligence—i.e., lack reason—still act for an end, by nature. (For example, an animal hunts for food, a ball falls after it is tossed into the air, the air temperature outside cools when the sun goes down.) Whatever acts for an end by its very nature, even without understanding why or reasoning why, must be directed to do so by an intelligent being, via a nature given to the unintelligent created being, whether it be an animal, a ball, or air temperature. So the world must have an intelligent designer, who designs this nature and institutes this plan for the unintelligent being. The design of nature itself is not something a created being, or a being subject to nature, can provide. Something outside creation, and therefore someone or something with power over creation and power over the natural law that is a part of creation, must exist. This must be God."

example_larger: "Consider it this way; natural law (specifically, the law of nature and the order and plan according to which the world works), exists self-evidently and obviously, and exists regardless of any decision by a created being (or a group of beings) and apart from any control by a created being over the law or especially the consequences associated with the law. To illustrate the point; all human beings could join together and decide that all trees should grow to a uniform height. Human beings could collectively decide as much, but would still have absolutely no control over the actual consequences of the decision and no power to bring about the result decided. The fact that these consequences do not and cannot come about from human decision or human will is self-evident. Natural plans and patterns, and consequences as well, that are NOT caused by a created thing’s decision and that can NOT be controlled by a created thing, must therefore be caused by something with power over all creation and all nature, something that is itself NOT CREATED. The world and the created order works according to a design that includes determined plans and consequences, which are above the decisions of created beings. Some other being must then have created this nature and the natural order, and determined the nature and order according to which creation works and does not work. And again, to bring about this order of all creation, this being cannot then have itself been created."

question_larger: "Who—by nature—is the intelligent designer? Would you want to know the designer? Understand the designer? Find out why the designer designs? Find out if, or why, the designer…designed you?"
