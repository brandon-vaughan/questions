title: A Greatest Being

categories: question

class: question--greatest

question_lead: "How do you have certain talents and certain struggles? Why are you better at some things than you are at others? Can you conceive of what perfection at any one thing in your life might look like?"

example_lead: "One man stands before a barbell with 200-pounds upon it. He lifts the barbell up and then over his head. Another man, of equal height and weight stands before an identical barbell. He attempts to lift it, but cannot. The first man can be said to have a greater strength than the second. A penguin, standing on a floating mass of ice, flaps its wings but cannot fly. A canary flutters around a flower, its wings moving up and down at a rapid pace, keeping it aloft for an extended period of time. The canary can be said to have a greater capacity for flight than the penguin does. The temperature in Antarctica on a given day may be 1-degree F, while the temperature in Italy on that same day may be 85-degree F. Italy can be said to have a greater temperature, or a greater degree of heat. Conversely, Antarctica can be said to have a greater degree of cold."

answer: "Some things are greater than others are, or have a higher degree of greatness, or are closer to a full degree of greatness, such as a man who is stronger than another man, a canary that flies better than a penguin, or a temperature that is hotter than another temperature. Whatever is great to any degree—for example, whatever can fly better, is hotter, or is stronger—must get its degree of “greatness” from that being which has a capacity for complete greatness, against which a degree of greatness is measured; a being which has the capacity to create something great and provide it with its degree of greatness. To put it another way, whatever is closer to perfection to any degree must get its degree of perfection from that being which is perfect. There must be a greatest and perfect thing, which is the source of all greatness, of all perfection and of the varying degrees of each. This must be God."

example_larger: "Gravity exists all throughout the universe, to varying degrees. The earth has more gravity than the moon. A being which therefore has the power over all gravity, and therefore over the greatest possible concept of gravity, must have a role in the creation of gravity and the conditions by which gravity exists and by which its varying degrees are determined. With that, the universe is ever-expanding, and great in terms of size—potentially so great as to be limitless according to a human definition of size. The universe is created matter; it exists; it is filled with material; it came into existence at a certain time. Someone or something with the power to create that which is limitless, ever-expanding, and filled with material order, and to do so out of nothing, or to create out of nothing the conditions and materials that brought the universe about, must exist. This someone or something must have full power over the greatness of the universe; the greatness to set the conditions by which the universe operates and according to which the universe is great—the conditions by which it expands always, the matter or space into which it expands (what could that be?), the conditions by which its planets orbit, by which its galaxies rest, by which its gravity operates."

question_larger: "You exist, and are a part of this created universe. Why do you have the strengths and gifts that you have? What role might a greatest being have in them? Could a greatest being have a purpose for you, with respect to the use of your strengths and gifts?"
